h1.Tabulatr - Index Tables made easy, finally

h2.Mission Objective

Tabulatr aims at making the ever-recurring task of creating listings of ActiveRecord models simple and uniform.

We found ourselves reinventing the wheel in every project we made, by using

* different paging mechanisms,
* different ways of implementing filtering/searching,
* difterent ways of implementing selecting and batch actions,
* different layouts.

We finally thought that whilst gems like Formtastic or SimpleForm provide a really cool, uniform, and concise way to implement forms, it's time for a table builder. During a project with Magento (*shiver*) we decided that their general tables are quite reasonable, and enterprise-proven -- so that's our starting point. 

h3.Visual Components

Every Tabulatr table consists of the following components:

* a wrapping form
* a 'Controls Container' containing the table-controls as
  * the paginator, 
  * the batch_actions, 
  * the submit button, 
  * controls to manage selecting/checking/marking, 
  * an info_text
* The actual table consisting of
  * A header row,
  * A filter row,
  * data rows,
  * possibly a selecting/checking/marking column
  * possibly action links/buttons
  
Whilst this is a strong decision, we made everything as-configurable-as-possible, there are roughly 150 options you can use to tweak almost every aspect of Tabulatr.

h3.Features

Tabulatr tries to make these common tasks as simple/transparent as possible:
* paging
* selecting/checking/marking
* filtering
* batch actions

h2.Example

h3.Models

We suppose we have a couple of models
* tags has and belong to many products
* vendors have many products
* products belong to vendors and have and belong to many tags
  
h3.Controller

In the products controllers index action we have:

def index
  @products = Product.find_for_table(params)
end

the find_for_table method is injected into ActiveRecord by Tabulatr, it retrieves all relevant data from the params hash automagically.

h3.View

To get a simple Table, all we need to do is

<h1>Listing products</h1>

<%= table_for @products do 
  t.column :id
  t.column :title
  t.column :price
  t.column :active
  t.association :vendor, :name
  t.association :tags, :title
end %>

<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>

but the result is pretty fancy, already:
